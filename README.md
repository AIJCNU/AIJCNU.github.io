# AIJC @ NU
## The Graduate Student Led Journal Club for Artificial Intelligence Research at Northwestern University

## A Casual Place To Present, Ponder, and Discuss AI at Northwestern
Artificial Intelligence is historically and inherently an interdisciplinary 
field of research. Many of the biggest advancements in the field 
have come from incorporating insights from neuroscience, psychology, statistics,
economics, human factors, linguistics, physics, topology, biology, and many other academic disciplines.
As graduate students, it can sometimes be difficult to meet people who
approach AI research from another research perspective. AI journal club
is meant to be used as a place where we can casually present, critique,
and discuss publications in AI among a variety of peers who can 
help contextualize the contributions and perspective of the material
in other disciplines. Presentations vary from being as casual as a light discussion
around the ethical concerns of AI raised by legal scholars to interactive demonstrations
of cutting edge neural network architectures. We welcome graduate students from
any department to attend and participate in discussion and encourage
regular attendees to present research heavily related to their own work,
research that they would like to solicit help in understanding, and research
that can foster important conversations regarding the future of AI.
