# AIJC @ NU
## The Graduate Student Led Journal Club for Artificial Intelligence Research at Northwestern University

## A Casual Place To Present, Ponder, and Discuss AI at Northwestern
Artificial Intelligence is historically and inherently an interdisciplinary 
field of research. Many of the biggest advancements in the field 
have come from incorporating insights from neuroscience, psychology, statistics,
economics, human factors, linguistics, physics, topology, biology, 
and many other academic disciplines. AI Journal Club is meant to be a place where we can 
present, critique, and discuss research (both seminal and also cutting-edge) in a welcoming
environment with a diversity of viewpoints. Presentations range from casual paper discussions,
to in-depth tutorials of cutting-edge techniques in AI to spirited debates over the ethical 
implications of AI. We welcome graduate students from any department to attend and participate 
in discussion and encourage regular attendees to present research related to their own work, 
research that they would like to solicit help in understanding, research that can foster 
conversations about the future of our field, or just research that is interesting and sparks 
novel and exciting ideas.
